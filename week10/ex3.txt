After removal of execute permission for everybody:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 violetta violetta 0 окт 20 15:19 _ex3.txt

After granting all permissions to owner and others:
-rwxrw-rwx 1 violetta violetta 0 окт 20 15:19 _ex3.txt

After making group permissions equal to user permissions:
-rwxrwxrwx 1 violetta violetta 0 окт 20 15:19 _ex3.txt


Explanation:
this output in this file was generated by
ls -l _ex3.txt >> ex3.txt

the 10 digit string in the beginning of each output represents permissions for owner(user), group and others.
first digit means type (- means that it is some plain file)
next 3 digits are permissions for Owner; rwx means Owner has all permissions, if any letter is substituded by "-", it would mean that corresponding permission is not granted (r for read, w for write, x for execute)
next 3 digits - same for group
last 3 digits - for others


Another representation of permissions is numbers in base 8:
660 in base 8 is 110110000 in base 2, which means rw-rw---- -read and write permission for user and group and no permissions for others
775 is 111111101 -> rwxrwxr-x - all permissions for everybody except write for others
777 is 111111111 -> rwxrwxrwx - all permissions for everybody
